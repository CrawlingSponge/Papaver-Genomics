## **Welcome to _Papaver_-Genomics Data Pages**

_Papaver_ species have very important evolutionary positions, and they are the main source for the Morphinans, which are important pain-killing alkaloids. How and why _Papaver_ species produce Morphinans is very interesting. We sequenced three _Papaver_ species genome aimming to address these questions and decode the their eveolutionary history.

Here is the omics data warehouse for _Papaver_ species.
